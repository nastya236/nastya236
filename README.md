I am a MS student at Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne 🇨🇭 ⛰️

Also, I am a research assistant at [Adaptive Motor Control Lab](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org) headed by [Mackenzie Mathis](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/mackenziemathis) 🐁 🧠

I am working in the intersection of AI and Natural Science 🧬 🔥

During my undergraduate studies, I worked in the [Machine Intelligence Lab](http://mil-team.com) as AI Researcher 👩‍💻

My research endeavor is to build models and algorithms for learning data-type invariant features and relations. To be more specific, I am interested in self-supervised learning for behaviour understanding. For more information about my research, please, check my [profile](https://anasfil.io)!
