Currently I am working as ML Enineer at Apple Machine Learning Researchüçè on efficent training and inference of LLMs.

I did my undegrad in Applied Math and Physics at MIPT in Moscow and Master's in Data Science at EPFL in Lausanne.

During my Master's I was a part of [Adaptive Motor Control Lab](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org) headed by amazing [Mackenzie Mathis](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/mackenziemathis) doing research in the intersection of AI and Neuroscience [mostly working on self-supervised learning and pose estimation]. 
Also spent sometime at WorldQuant as an intern.

During undergrad I worked for 2 years at [Machine Intelligence Lab](http://mil-team.com) as AI Researcher.
